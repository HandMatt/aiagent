# Project extension ideas

- Extended unit tests
- Add code commentary and notes

Try to make the agent:
- Fix harder and more complex bugs
- Refactor sections of code
- Add entirely new features

Try:
- Other LLM providers
- Other Gemini models
- Giving it more functions to call
- Other codebases (Commit your changes before running the agent so you can always revert!)
